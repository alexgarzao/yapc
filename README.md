# yapc
Yet another proxy caching (YAPC) is an open source Transparent HTTP Proxy Caching, similar to NGINX, ATS and SQUID.

My goal with this project is to learn Golang. Of course, if someone interesting in contribute or use, feel free to contact me :-)

Nowadays, I only started to think about what the project is (and isn't), your basic architecture, planned versions, ...

Bellow I will put what in my mind :-)

# Planned versions
* Only proxy, with basic access control. With the map configuration will be possible to specifier what can be accessed and what cannot.
* Proxy + cache
* Transparent caching proxy
